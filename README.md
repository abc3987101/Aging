# Aging

This document serves as supplemental materials for the ongoing paper "Individualized Prediction of Depressive Disorder in the Elderly: A Multitask Deep Learning Approach," which is under review in the International Journal of Medical Informatics.

This document provides the source code for the paper. The raw data is available at https://www.rand.org/well-being/social-and-behavioral-policy/centers/aging/dataprod/hrs-data.html. We uploaded data samples in file "datafile" as well.

To run main.py, one should first run preprocessing.py which will do data preprocessing for the raw data.
